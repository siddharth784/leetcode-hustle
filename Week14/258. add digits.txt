https://leetcode.com/problems/add-digits/discuss/1754049/Easy-O(1)-Explanation-with-Example

Do look the explanation before trying to make sense of the code, because it won't. That's cuz the question belongs to the concept of "digital root" which is a topic of Number Theory, which I haven't studied till yet.

class Solution {
    public int addDigits(int num) {
        if(num==0)
            return 0;
        if(num%9==0)
            return 9;
        else
            return (num%9);
    }
}
