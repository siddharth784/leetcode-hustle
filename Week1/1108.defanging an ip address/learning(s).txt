1. I reminded myself that to append a character or string to a string, we can simply use the '+' operator. no hassle.

2.String ans;	//this will show error that ans was not intialised. so apparently strings can and should only be declared these ways:
String ans=new String();
String ans=new String("");
String ans="";
