the following code is invalid and gives out errors. this is most likely because temp is a string and not a char array. so ch can't just modularly intake temp's elements in the iterations. the alternative of the code is below the following code.

//wrong way
for(char ch:temp){	//where temp is a String
    if(ch==' ')
    counter++;
}

//right way
for(int i=0;i<temp.length();i++){
	if(temp.charAt(i)==' ')
      counter++;
}
