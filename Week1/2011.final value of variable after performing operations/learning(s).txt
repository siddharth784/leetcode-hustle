as I even pointed out in the comments of the solution code of this question, == operator is useless for comparing the equality of two strings. == operator compares addresses and in the case of char datatype it compares their respective ascii values. While for strings it's useless. 
For strings, we have to use string method of java: str1.equals(str2);	//returns boolean
e.g.	if(strarr[i].equals("yes it was"))
	System.out.print("Y");
