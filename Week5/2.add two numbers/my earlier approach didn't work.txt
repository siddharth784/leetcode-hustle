MY APPROACH OF FINDING FIRST GIVEN LL KA NUMBER, SECOND NUMBER, THEN LEECHING OUT THE DIGITS OF THEIR SUM AND ADDING THEM AS NODES IN A NEW LL, HAS FAILED. IT FAILED FOR LEETCODE HAS SUCH BIG NUMBERS IN THE CASES OF THIS QUESTION, THAT EVEN USING LONG OR BIGINTEGER WON'T HELP. THEY PURPOSELY DID SO, SO THAT MY APPROACH FAILS. THEY WANT THE QUESTION TO BE DONE IN A PROFESSIONAL(MODIFYING ANSWER LL NODE BY NODE) AND NOT A BRUTE FORCE LIKE METHOD.

THE APPROACH THAT I HAVE USED, I LEARNT IT FROM THIS HINT/SOLUTION: https://leetcode.com/problems/add-two-numbers/discuss/1835535/JavaC%2B%2B-A-very-beautiful-explanation-EVER-exists
