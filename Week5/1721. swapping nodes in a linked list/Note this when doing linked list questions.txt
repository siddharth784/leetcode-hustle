LINKED LISTS KI VALUES ARE MUTABLE. THEY CAN BE CHANGED. SO WHEN THE VALUES OF TWO NODES ARE ASKED TO BE SWAPPED LIKE IN THIS QUESTION, YOU DON'T NEED TO SWAP THE NODES THEMSELVES. I WAS EARLIER TRYING TO SWAP THE NODES THEMSELVES, THAT'S WHAT YOU'LL SEE IN THE COMMENTS OF MY SOLUTION CODE. 
THEY HAVE EVEN CATEGORICALLY SPECIFIED: SWAP VALUES OF KTH NODE AND (N-K)TH NODE, NOT NODE THEMSELVES.
AND EVEN WHEN IT'S NOT SPECIFIED, ALWAYS CHECK IF YOU CAN DO THE ASKED JOB BY MODIFYING MERELY THE NODE'S VALUE.
