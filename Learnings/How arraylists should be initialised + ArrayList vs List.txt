ArrayList<Boolean> result=new ArrayList<>();
This initialisation is fine.

List<Boolean> result=new ArrayList<>();
This initialisation is fine.

List<Boolean> result=new List<>();
This initialisation is not fine.

So basically although we often times substitute ArrayList with List but in some places(idk which ones exactly) including initialisation, we need to write full name "ArrayList" so to be on safer side always use full name.
