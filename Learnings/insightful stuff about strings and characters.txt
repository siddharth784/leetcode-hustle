I have done leetcode q1859 by my own approach and method, which you can find in pc. And there is a solved answer to same question link of which i am giving here:

I think there is a lot to learn from her code.
Some of it is:
1. How we must use StringBuilder more often to preserve space and time
2. How we can think of different approach altogether. Like I have done question by hashmap, while she has used new string array, and an index pointer whose value she updates according to the iteration
3. sb.toString(); where sb is a StringBuilder
4. sb.append(ans[i]);
5. String[] str=s.split(" "); seperates the string elements which have space in b/w, and puts them in array.
