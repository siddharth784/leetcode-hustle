Here is How I solve a Leetcode Problem✌

1. Will set a Timer for 1 hour. 🕖
2. Will start from brute force and will try to climb to the optimized one.
3. After 1 hour there are 3 scenarios that I consider

a) Approach is accepted.✌️

Now I will think of another approach or watch some optimized approaches in Discuss section.

b) I have an approach but it has some implementation bugs.🛠️

Now I will take a break from that question and will do some other tasks. 50% of the time I am able to code that problem after that break.

c) I don't have an approach.🤷‍♂️

Now I will add that Problem link to my Leetcode folder and will restart doing it after one day.

The next day I will solve that problem and if failed, will take help and code it. Now I will add that problem link to the Revision folder.🙃

I mostly pick Revise Problems on weekends and I follow the same process till I am able to code that problem properly.🐤

So this is the pattern I am sticking with for the past 1 month and it really helped me a lot.

PS: You can dm your doubts or add them in the comments, I will try replying back for sure.❤️
