java.lang.Math contains very useful mathematical methods/functions. java.util.*; library package prolly contains it already.some of functions it contains are:

Math.abs(int a); or Math.abs(float c)
best thing is that it will return the absolute/mod value in same datatype as the argument, whether int or float or long or short or double

Math.pow(a,b) 
it prolly returns float even if a and b are int. so it becomes necessary to do narrowing casting on it by putting (int) in the beginning.

Math.sqrt()
it probably returns in double(remember double is more precise than float). so do narrowing casting as need be.
