LONG STORY:		Doing this question the normal way will give you error:

And why? because nextInt() sirf integer input leta hai. wo '/n' ya nextline ko consume/input nhi leta. as a result, terminal pe hum enter maar bhi dein doesn't matter, nextInt will still look forward to taking input in the next line.
 
Basically, the reasoning goes something like this:

And you can't run the following code having omitted input.nextLine():
System.out.print("Insert a number: ");
int number = input.nextInt();
input.nextLine(); // This line you have to add (It consumes the \n character)
System.out.print("Text1: ");
String text1 = input.nextLine();
System.out.print("Text2: ");
String text2 = input.nextLine();
