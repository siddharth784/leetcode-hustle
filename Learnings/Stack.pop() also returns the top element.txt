Stack pop() Method in Java
pop() method in Java is used to pop an element from the stack. The element is popped from the top of the stack and is removed from the same. Parameters: The method does not take any parameters. Return Value: This method returns the element present at the top of the stack and then removes it.

BASICALLY WE CAN POP THE TOPMOST ELEMENT WHILE AT THE SAME TIME USE IT FOR THE LAST TIME.
E.G. INT TEMP=ST.POP();
NOW IF THE TOP ELEMENT OF THE STACK WAS 20, TEMP=20 AND THAT ELEMENT WILL ALSO BE REMOVED FROM THE STACK.

HENCE, STACK.POP()=STACK.PEEK()+STACK.POP()
