in q48, I had to transpose then horizontally mirror the matrix. but that didn't click until seeing the solution. Now that I think about it, I think that I should've atleast thought about transposing the matrix once. because in matrix/mirroring/transformation of matrix questions, transpose is often used.

So learn to check out transpose option when doing matrix and such questions, and also learn tranposing ka algo.

for(int i=0;i<matrix.length;i++){
for(int j=0;j<i;j++){
swap(matrix,i,j,j,i);
}
}
